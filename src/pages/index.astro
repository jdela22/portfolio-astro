				Hi! I'm Jared Delapasse. I built this site to learn a bit about the
				astro framework and to act as a quasi-blog for the latest things I am
				interested in or any books I may be reading.

			<!-- <p>In my free time I try to learn skills and concepts I don't come across at work. Currently, I'm wrapping up an exellent series by Thorsten Ball about Interpreters and compilers.</p> -->
