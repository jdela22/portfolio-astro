			With LLMs becoming a more integrated piece of development workflows, the
			primary role of a software engineer is becoming less about writing code
			and evolving more towards an emphasis on developing fault-tolerant,
			scalable systems. This book comes highly recommended by many experienced
			software developers online and I'm looking forward to gaining more insight
			to working with data on a mass scale.
