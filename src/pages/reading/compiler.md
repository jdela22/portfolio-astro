			A sequel to the interpreter book and goes a bit further and walks through
			the process of setting up of using a compiler rather than an evaluator to
			traverse the AST. It extends the previously constructed interpreter to
			include the production of bytecode, as well as constructing a minimal
			virtual machine to execute the bytecode.
