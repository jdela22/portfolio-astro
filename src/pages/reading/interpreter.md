			This book walks you through the creation of an interpreter for an
			imaginary programming language. It is very basic, and syntactially looks
			similar to your more basic scripting languages.
		

			It helped me gain an even deeper understanding of various javascript
			concepts that I had previously considered myself to have understood well.
			Things like closures and higher order functions become much clearer and
			seem almost natural when you have implemented them. It walks through the
			creation of a lexer to convert programs into tokens, a parser to create
			the abstract syntaxs tree, and an evaluator that traverses the tree to
			return a result.
