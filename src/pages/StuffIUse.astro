			Over the past few years my development workflow has shifted pretty heavily
			to revolving around the terminal. I've found that the learning curve of
			CLI tools (although admittedly steep) is often worth the experience you
			get when interfacing directly with the tools you're using. GUIs are nice
			when needing only surface level knowledge or when first getting started.
			But as I've gotten more experienced, speed and flexibility are two
			attributes I've come to value most in new tools. The CLI variations of
			developer tools tend to prioritize those values.

		you're curious how I set mine up or you're looking for a jumping off point,
		you can take a look at my dotfiles. I keep them pretty up-to-date for my own
		use when setting up new machines. LINK TO DOTFILES
